## Solutions here:

- **Link Shortener (lnk-sht):**
  This macro will shortener the hyperlink in the active cell. Sometimes at work you need to compile multiple informations in one  single spreadsheet, and this includes hyperlinks to external data. The  problem is: Hyperlinks dont have the same size, so to make it standard  you need to shorten them, here I will use Bitly to shorten hyperlinks  and make all the same size. 
- **Create a timer to run a macro (tmr):**
  A macro will be run after a certain time. Sometimes you create a macro you want to run several times, after a  specified time interval. When you run "minhaMacro" bellow you will make it run after each 15  minutes, and if you ever need it to stop, simply run "paraTimer".
